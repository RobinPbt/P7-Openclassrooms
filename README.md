# P7-Openclassrooms
This repository has been created in the context of the 7th project of my Data Scientist training with Openclassrooms. 
The goal of this project is to use datas from a former Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data) to build a classification model.
The model is a binary classification with a positive class corresponding to a customer with loan repayment difficulties.
The model must take into consideration a business optimization considering false negatives have a bigger impact than a false positive on bank revenues.
Then the model is deployed throught an API to make predictions and a dashboard to display results visually.

This repository concerns the preprocessing and modeling part of the project.

The preprocessing part has been inspired by this kernel : https://www.kaggle.com/code/jsaguiar/lightgbm-with-simple-features/script
